name: clinical-documentation
description: Turn an uploaded consultation recording or transcript into an evidence-linked German Arztbrief or English medical report draft, with a separate list of unclear details and suggested follow-up questions. Use for clinical documentation, not diagnosis, prescribing, or hospital discharge summaries without the required records.

# Clinical documentation

Produce three deliverables: the unchanged transcript, a report draft with source
references, and separate uncertainties/suggested questions. Do not silently
rewrite the transcript, correct unclear medication names, infer normal findings,
or turn a doctor's unanswered question into a negative answer. Suggestions are
not facts to insert in the letter. These models and this workflow have not been
clinically validated; a clinician must review the draft before using it in a
record. Do not claim that a question was never asked just because it is absent
from the recording.

## Uploaded audio or an existing transcript

Use the bundled executable workflow when the client provides a file-capable
execution environment. Resolve the actual current user's attachment to a local
file; an attachment label or remote path is not audio. Use the user's ordinary
platform credential through `FS2_API_KEY` or `FS2_API_KEY_FILE`, never in tool
arguments, source, chat, or output. `FS2_BASE_URL` selects the platform origin.
The platform key needs access to the appropriate Nemotron speech App, with
catalog, inference, operations/result and artifact-write scopes. Choose the
report model explicitly; the tested profile is Qwen-235B on Nebius Token Factory.
The executor operator configures its provider credential separately and does
not disclose that credential in chat or to MCP clients.

```bash
uv run /path/to/clinical-documentation/scripts/clinical_report.py \
  --audio /user-workspace/consultation.wav --language de \
  --report-provider https://api.tokenfactory.nebius.com/v1 \
  --report-model Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507 \
  --output /user-workspace/consultation-report
```

English uses `--language en`. The helper selects English Nemotron for English
and multilingual Nemotron for German; it verifies the Apps are visible to the
current key. To reuse a completed transcription, use `--transcript file.txt`
(or ASR JSON with `text`) instead of `--audio`. For finalized uploaded audio,
use `--artifact audio-reference.json`. It contains only the immutable artifact
reference, not a URL or file bytes. Do not submit the same audio again just to
change the report model.

The helper uploads real bytes outside model arguments, handles async operations
and long-result artifacts, extracts facts in overlapping numbered source
segments with schema-constrained generation, builds exact citations itself,
performs an automated contextual fact review, and renders those facts into the
report. It keeps excluded candidates for inspection.
Literal citations and a second model pass do not prove medical correctness.
Review important facts against the transcript and, where unclear, the recording.

Deliver `report.md`, `follow-up.md`, and `transcript.txt` as downloadable files;
`document.json` carries structured facts and exact source character offsets.
`review.md` makes withheld candidates readable; `review.json` retains their
structured evidence. Inspect these alongside the report: the automatic reviewer
can reject a correct fact. Empty report sections mean no entries were assigned,
not that the consultation lacked that information. `run.json` and `calls/`
retain provenance, model usage and operation IDs. These files contain sensitive
content: use the existing per-user workspace, not public repository storage.
Successful extraction is not proof of completeness. Deliver the review queue
alongside the report rather than hiding omitted candidates. Suggested questions
can repeat answered points or contain speculative rationales; review them before
using them with a patient. Do not present them as a validated clinical checklist.

Rerun the **same command and output directory** to resume a pending operation
without retranscribing. A new input, language, prompt or model needs a new output
directory. A completed directory is immutable. Empty audio/transcripts, terminal
model errors and truncated JSON are explicit incomplete runs, not blank letters.
Report the saved operation ID when blocked. Do not repeatedly create new runs
or change deployment settings. There is no new access policy in this skill.

## MCP-only client

In the Scientific AI LibreChat deployment, prefer the `scientific-demos`
bridge when present. `clinical_report_from_transcript` starts the same helper
with a per-user platform key held by the server. Save its job ID and use
`clinical_get_job`/`clinical_read_output` to retrieve the draft, transcript,
review queue and questions. For audio or large files use the authenticated
`/demos?tab=clinical` upload panel; an attachment label alone is not transferred
to this tool. After an interrupted job use `clinical_resume_job`, not a new
submission. Missing clinical tools require reconnecting the scientific-demos
MCP server, not exposing credentials or switching to a shared root executor.

If the client only has MCP tools, discover `list_models` and `get_model_schema`.
Use the advertised typed Nemotron transcription tool with a finalized audio
artifact, exact `options.model` and explicit language. Save the operation ID,
poll `get_operation`, then retrieve `get_operation_result`; externalized results
need the normal file/artifact bridge. Never paste audio/base64 into tool calls.

Once the transcript is available as a file, run the bundled helper with
`--transcript` through the client's file executor. A `SKILL.md` does not install
that executor or transfer the MCP user's key to it. If absent, explain this
specific integration requirement; do not claim that the executable report
workflow ran. An agent may prepare a clearly labeled manual draft from an
accessible transcript at the user's request, but must not fabricate helper
validation, source offsets, files or measured results.

## Report models and limits

There is deliberately no small-model default: live tests found important
omissions and wrong citations with `qwen3-8b` and the tested NVIDIA Nemotron Nano.
The current recommended profile is
`Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507` at
`https://api.tokenfactory.nebius.com/v1`. Configure its credential with
`CLINICAL_REPORT_API_KEY_FILE` (protected secret mount) or
`CLINICAL_REPORT_API_KEY`; `CLINICAL_REPORT_MODEL` and
`CLINICAL_REPORT_BASE_URL` can hold the non-secret defaults above.

Without `--report-provider`/`CLINICAL_REPORT_BASE_URL`, an explicit
`--report-model` selects an authorized platform OpenAI-chat App using only the
platform key. This mode exists, but the tested small cluster model is not a
qualified report profile. The host agent can instead help review a draft; that
does not change which model actually generated the saved report.
Never silently send clinical content to another provider or use its key as the
platform key. Changing models requires quality testing, not just catalog
discovery. The provider comparison results and negative runs are documented in
the solution's `acceptance/clinical-documentation-20260917/README.md`.

The report is a consultation-note/Arztbrief draft, not a discharge summary,
clinical decision, or signed document. Speaker identity is not established by
the default ASR. Do not infer patient/clinician identity from voice alone.
Recorded audio is supported; live microphone capture requires a separate client.
Long transcripts are chunked without truncation. Questions are omitted with an
explicit notice if the complete fact set exceeds the question context budget;
no completeness claim is made for long or multi-encounter recordings. Separate
different encounters before submission.
